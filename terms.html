    <p>Some parts of Service are billed on a subscription basis (“<strong>Subscription(s)</strong>”). You will be billed in advance on a recurring and periodic basis (“<strong>Billing Cycle</strong>”). Billing cycles are set either on a monthly or annual basis, depending on the type of subscription plan you select when purchasing a Subscription.</p>
    <p>At the end of each Billing Cycle, your Subscription will automatically renew under the exact same conditions unless you cancel it or Replicate cancels it. You may cancel your Subscription renewal either through your online account management page or by contacting Replicate customer support team.</p>
    <p>A valid payment method, including credit card, is required to process the payment for your subscription. You shall provide Replicate with accurate and complete billing information including full name, telephone number, and a valid payment method. By submitting such payment information, you automatically authorize Replicate to charge all Subscription fees incurred through your account to any such payment instruments.</p>
    <p>Should automatic billing fail to occur for any reason, Replicate will issue an electronic invoice indicating that you must proceed manually, within a certain deadline date, with the full payment corresponding to the billing period as indicated on the invoice.</p>
    <ol start="5" type="1">
      <li>
        <p><strong><u>Fee Changes</u></strong></p>

    <p>Replicate, in its sole discretion and at any time, may modify Subscription fees for the Subscriptions. Any Subscription fee change will become effective at the end of the then-current Billing Cycle.</p>
    <p>Replicate will provide you with a reasonable prior notice of any change in Subscription fees to give you an opportunity to terminate your Subscription before such change becomes effective.</p>
    <p>Your continued use of Service after Subscription fee change comes into effect constitutes your agreement to pay the modified Subscription fee amount.</p>
